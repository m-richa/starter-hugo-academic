I graduated in 2019 from BITS-Pilani after completing the integrated first-degree program in Biological Science and Electrical and Electronics Engineering. After graduation, I worked in the industry as a software engineer at HSBC for 2 years. I am currently working with Dr Avinash Sharma on 4D reconstruction of human body.
